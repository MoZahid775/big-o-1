Frequency Counter -------------------------------
//Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding
//value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. 


//Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of
another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.



Multiple Pointer ---------------------------------
Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

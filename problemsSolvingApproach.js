/*  1- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    
2- write a function that adds two numbers
-ints?
-floats?
-what about string for large numbers?

3- What are the inputes that go into the problem?
-int? float? string?

4- can the outputs be determined from the inpute


function charCount (str) {
  //do something 
  //return lower case alpha number keys
}


function charCount (str) {
  /make object to return at end
  
  //loop over string, for each charaacter...
    //if the char is a key in the object, add one to count
    //if it is not in the object, add it and set value to one
    //if character is something else (space,perido, etc dont do anything)
  //return an object lower case alpha number keys
}

1) HWat are the inputs going into the pronblem?
2) what are the outputs?
3) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
4) how can i label the really imporant pieces of information in the problem?
